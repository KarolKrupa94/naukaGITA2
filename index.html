            <p>Bury all your secrets in my skin<br>
                Come away with innocence and leave me with my sins<br>
                The air around me still feels like a cage <br>
                And love is just a camouflage <br>
                for what resembles rage again <br> 
            </p>
            <p>
                So if you love me let me go And run away before I know <br>
                My heart is just too dark to care I can't destroy what isn't there <br>
                Deliver me into my fate If I'm alone I cannot hate <br>
                I don't deserve to have you <br>
                Ooh, my smile was taken long ago <br>
                If I can change I hope I never know <br>
            </p>
            <p>       
                I still press your letters to my lips <br>
                And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss <br>
                I couldn't face a life without your lights <br>
                But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight <br>
            </p>      
            <p>
                So save your breath, I will not hear <br> 
                I think I made it very clear <br> 
                You couldn't hate enough to love Is that supposed to be enough? <br>
                I only wish you weren't my friend <br>
                Then I could hurt you in the end <br>
                I never claimed to be a saint <br> 
                Ooh, my own was banished long ago <br> 
                It took the death of hope to let you go <br>        
            </p>
            <p>
                So break yourself against my stones
                And spit your pity in my soul
                You never needed any help
                You sold me out to save yourself
                And I won't listen to your shame
                You ran away, you? re all the same
                Angels lie to keep control
                oh, my love was punished long ago
                If you still care don't ever let me know
                If you still care don't ever let me know
            </p>
